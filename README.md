Another Internet Archive, but only will archive the black house with some white letters; this wildcard thing is used for art trade.

This repository still in beta and it has a different way to archive files on this unexistent web, it has different rules for archive files and it needs request for archive some characters or images succesfully.

ANOTHER WARNING: Will start with no images, and it cannot be archived, untill someone request an character for be archived. After being archived, it cannot be deleted after the request for reasons of show the history. So if you requesting me to delete an image or character, the Access will be Denied.


This repository for not have a predeterminated link, it's not original. Be a member if you want to collaborate with me.
